OKI Standard 001 - OSTR - Dynamic Str Strings
Strings as in "Hello World"

trivial: I'm not naming this just 'Dynamic Strings' simply because of the confusion
related to strings and arrays, BUT in this document I will still refer to them
as dynamic strings, always saying dynamic str strings sounds dumb.

I. DEFINITION
DYNAMIC STRINGS ARE JUST DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED CHAR ARRAYS WITH [II] STRING
TERMINATORS.

II. STRING TERMINATOR
ALL DYNAMIC STRING SHOULD BE TERMINATED WITH THE ASCII NULL CHARACTER (0, '\0').                    # very original...
THIS 'STRING TERMINATOR' CHARACTER WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE STRING LENGTH. 
THIS ALSO HELPS WITH COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER STANDARDS.
